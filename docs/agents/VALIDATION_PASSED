- 5/5 analyzer backends implemented (claude, claude-bedrock, openai, azure-openai, noop)
- 6/6 built-in sinks implemented (log, slack, pagerduty, s3, webhook, kubernetes-event)
- 4/4 CRD types defined with deepcopy and YAML manifests (WormsignDetector, WormsignGatherer, WormsignSink, WormsignPolicy)
- 12/12 Prometheus metrics defined per Section 7.3.1
- 9/9 filter evaluation levels implemented per Section 6.2
- 4/4 correlation rules implemented (NodeCascade, DeploymentRollout, StorageCascade, NamespaceStorm)
- Pipeline orchestrator with per-stage queues and severity-based priority
- Shard manager with consistent hashing and ConfigMap coordination
- Controller lifecycle with 7-step graceful shutdown (Section 2.6)
- Leader election with Lease object (Section 3.6)
- Health endpoints /healthz and /readyz (Section 2.7)
- CEL-based custom detector engine with cost budget
- Redaction engine with 7 default patterns
- Helm chart complete with all templates, RBAC, CRDs, values.yaml
- All tasks completed successfully, no permanently failed tasks with missing critical functionality

Build & Tests:
- Project builds successfully (go build ./...)
- go vet ./... passes with no issues
- helm lint passes with no errors
- helm template renders valid YAML
- 20/20 test packages passing with -race flag
- No TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX comments in codebase

Coverage (all internal/ packages above 80% target):
- internal/analyzer: 95.2%
- internal/analyzer/prompt: 94.0%
- internal/config: 98.0%
- internal/controller: 92.5%
- internal/detector: 99.4%
- internal/detector/cel: 93.8%
- internal/filter: 99.4%
- internal/gatherer: 94.3%
- internal/health: 96.9%
- internal/metrics: 100.0%
- internal/model: 94.7%
- internal/pipeline: 99.1%

Security:
- No critical or high severity vulnerabilities found
- API keys properly isolated via Kubernetes Secrets, never logged
- CEL expressions sandboxed with cost budget (1000 units default)
- SSRF protection: domain allowlist, HTTPS-only, IP rejection, localhost blocking, no-redirect HTTP client
- Secret redaction: 7 default patterns (Bearer tokens, AWS keys, passwords, etc.)
- Go text/template timeout (5s) prevents runaway templates
- RBAC follows least-privilege principle
- Structured logging (slog) prevents log injection
- Data races in detector Start/Stop fixed (commit f6d15e5)
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Dependencies up-to-date (Go 1.25, k8s client-go v0.35)

Previous Validation Round 1 Remediation:
- All remediation tasks from round 1 have been completed and verified
- No new issues introduced by the fixes
